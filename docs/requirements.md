Project 2 - Restaurant Website
You've been asked to design a website for a new restaurant opening at 348 E. Main St., Lexington, KY. The owners are busy working on their recipes and haven't picked a name yet, so they've asked you to suggest one and use it in your design.

The website needs to include at least:

The restaurant's name (give it a good one!)
The restaurant's address
The restaurant's hours of operation: Wednesday through Saturday, dinner only: 5pm - 10pm Sunday, brunch and dinner: 11am - 8pm
The restaurant's menu (including at least 8 entrees)
The owners are still working on their recipes. They've populated an API with possible choices. You are to use the API to generate a sample menu to add to your website. The API's URL is:

https://entree-s18.herokuapp.com/
Use the tools and technologies covered in class to complete your website. Minimally, that includes:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Git
Github
node
Express
Heroku
You may also use:

Bootstrap
Sass
Gulp
anything else you've learned on your own.
Organize your files in the web application pattern we've used in class.

To turn in your project, paste your Github repo and Heroku app links in the #project2 channel in Slack.

If you have time, consider the following additions to your project:

Each time you access the API, you get a different menu. Save the results in local storage so that every time your website is accessed, the user gets the same menu. (Different users will see different menus; that's okay for now.)

Include a different menu for each day of the week that the restaurant is open.

Embed a Google Map showing the location of the restaurant.

Of course, you are also free to make your own additions.

Have fun!
